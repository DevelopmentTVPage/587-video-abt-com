Nestled discreetly between the chimney and its outer ring, Modena's glass canopy adds a sense of lightness, augmenting the range hood's symmetry and low-pro\ufb01le design. A study in clean modern simplicity, Modena comes pre-loaded with DCBL Suppression System\u2122 technology so its performance will be as stunning as its looks.",
