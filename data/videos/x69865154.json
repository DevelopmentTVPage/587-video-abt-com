    "title": "How Does Induction Cooking Work",
    "description": "One of the main questions people ask when buying an induction cooktop is How do they work?.  An induction cooktop holds a series of burners called induction coils.  These coils generate magnetic fields that induct a warming reaction in steel and iron-based pots and pans.  This way the cookware heats the food and not the cooktop surface.  Keep in mind induction works best if the bottom of the pan is flat.  Induction uses 90 of its energy.  The response time is instant.  They are 50 faster then gas or electric cooktops.  Another myth about induction cooktops is that you have to run out and buy special cookware to use.  Induction-compatible cooktops consist of stainless with magnetic bottom enameled iron and steel or cast iron.  Non-compatible cookware would be copper glass aluminum and pottery-type vessels.  One of the easiest ways to tell if your cookware will work with an induction cooktop is to take a magnet stick it to the bottom of the pan -- if it sticks it works!  Keep in mind induction cooktops come in a variety of sizes.  From small and portable like this all the way up to 36-inches to fit in your kitchen.
