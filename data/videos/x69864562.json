The combination of the cameras image processor and this Leica Max 24 MP sensor guarantees outstanding imaging quality. Its intelligent design and flat pixel architecture enables each individual pixel to gather a particularly large amount of light. This results in images characterised by superior sharpness and maximum spatial resolution. The new M delivers extremely low-noise and richly detailed images even at higher sensitivities of up to ISO 6400. And now thanks to the 1080 pixel full-HD video capability of the Leica M the impressive imaging quality is available for moving pictures too.The new CMOS sensor is designed and constructed for the use of both Leica M and R lenses on the Leica M. Because with the new Leica R-Adapter M almost all Leica-R legacy lenses can be used on the Leica M expanding the options of the Leica M into the world of Leica R photography. \nFast Leica Maestro image processor \nIn conjunction with the new sensor the Leica Maestro processor lets the Leica M set entirely new standards in terms of image-processing speed. It processes the image data arriving from the sensor and transforms them into visible images at extremely high speeds and can also perform even the most complex processing steps very fast. Thanks to the energy-efficient imaging electronics of the processor and sensor a single charge of the Leica Ms new 1800 mAh lithium-ion battery can last an extremely long time. \nUniversal capabilities with Live View and the electronic viewfinder\nThe new Leica M is the first ever M to feature Live View and Live View Focusing. This means that now for the first time images can be composed using the actual image produced by the lens -- with complete control of depth of field exposure precise framing and focusing. Its large high-resolution 3 monitor allows precise assessment of the subject seen through the lens. This opens up entirely new opportunities for M-Photographers that previously lay far beyond the limitations of rangefinder photography like macro and telephoto exposures or using the monitor as a viewfinder.Live View can be used with both M and R lenses. Indirectly it also enables owners of R lenses to use the optional Visoflex EVF2 electronic viewfinder. The Leica M can be used with an R-Adapter R-Lenses and a viewfinder exactly like an SLR without using the monitor. \nSplash-proof camera body \nThanks to the many years of experience gathered by our engineers in the construction of camera bodies the new Leica M is built without compromise for maximum stability and perfect sealing. Its top and base plates are machined from solid brass and its full-metal body is manufactured in one piece from high-strength magnesium alloy. Specially designed rubber seals protect the camera body against dust and water spray. The glass covering plate of its high-resolution monitor screen is manufactured from particularly tough and scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla glass. All this makes the Leica M particularly resilient and helps guarantee it a long and reliable working life.",
