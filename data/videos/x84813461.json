The Slim Backlight Drive+, an evolution of Slim Backlight Drive, is a further improved grid-array backlighting system in a slim form factor which allows for even more precise local dimming control. With its quad-edge LED structure and X-tended Dynamic Range\u2122 PRO local dimming and boosting technology, it brings superior brightness and exceptional contrast \u2013 in fact it will deliver 10 times the XDR contrast* of conventional LED TV. The X940E features a full-array boosting and dimming backlight for precision contrast and incredible brightness.\n\nThe XBR-X930E\/X940E series also features the 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme, which offers 40% more real-time processing power than Sony\u2019s 4K Processor X1. The processor also takes all content and improves it to near 4K HDR quality. With object-based HDR remaster, the TV can detect, analyze and optimize each object in the picture individually to adjust the overall contrast for a more natural and realistic picture.\n\nX940E Series (75\u201d Class model) 4K HDR TV & X930E Series (65\u201d and 55\u201d Class models) 4K HDR TV Features:\n\n- Slim Backlight Drive+ with a unique quad-edge LED structure, allowing precise local dimming control which provides exceptional brightness and deeper blacks than a conventional full-array LED TV in an ultra slim design. (X930E only, the X940E is built in with full-array direct LED backlight.)\n\n- 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme provides the ultimate 4K HDR viewing experience by incorporating three new technologies: object-based HDR remaster, Super Bit Mapping 4K HDR and dual database processing.\n\n- X-tended Dynamic Range PRO enhances HDR and non-HDR content by boosting and dimming the backlight levels precisely for each zone of the screen with a unique backlighting algorithm. (10 times XDR contrast*)\n\n- Features vibrant, expanded color with TRILUMINOS Display, further enhanced for color accuracy.\n\n- Uses 4K X-Reality PRO to produce stunning detail with Sony\u2019s unique algorithm of reality creation database for any content, such as TV broadcasting, DVD, Blu-ray Disc, Internet video and digital photos.\n\n- The ultra slim design allows for flush with the wall mounting and clean cable management for table top mount.\n\n- Flush swivel mount gives easy access to ports and connections, while allowing the TV to sit flush to the wall\n\n- Android TV lets you explore a world of movies, music, photos, games, search, apps and more, including PlayStation Vue and Ultra services.
