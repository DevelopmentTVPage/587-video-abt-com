    "description": "Canon EOS 5DS Digital SLR Camera Body - 0581C002 http:\/\/www.abt.com\/product\/90887\/Canon-0581C002.html\n\nThe Freedom of High Resolution\nMarking a new standard in high-resolution digital SLR photography the Canon EOS 5DS camera shatters the status quo with a new 50.6 Megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor. Perfect for commercial and fine art photography or any other application that calls for extremely high-resolution the EOS 5DS is the ultimate combination of EOS performance and ultra-high megapixel capture. It features an advanced 61-point High Density Reticular AF system that includes 41 cross-type AF points and EOS iTR AF for precise AF in numerous situations. An anti-flicker function helps provide consistent exposure and color during continuous shooting under certain lighting conditions while a built-in bulb timer and intervalometer expands creative opportunities without the need for an additional remote control. A refined mirror control mechanism reduces vibration and a Time Release Lag setting minimizes camera shake for sharp image capture when using mirror lock-up. New features like a crop function of 1.3x and 1.6x and a Custom Quick Control screen are complemented by advanced multi-featured Full HD Movie capture with Time Lapse Movie and much more. With EOS performance and 50.6 Megapixel Capture the EOS 5DS revolutionizes high-resolution photography! \nFeatures:\n\u2022 Newly designed 50.6 Megapixel full-frame CMOS helps deliver ultra-high resolution images for large-scale printing and extensive creative cropping while Dual DIGIC 6 Image Processors enable spectacular image quality and processing speed.\n\u2022 EOS Scene Detection System features a 150000-pixel RGB+IR Metering Sensor for excellent precision.\n\u2022 61-Point High Density Reticular AF including up to 41 cross-type AF points and EOS iTR allows for high precision autofocus.\n\u2022 Advanced mirror control mechanism and new user-selectable shutter release time lag helps suppress camera vibration for reducing image shake.\n\u2022 Anti-flicker helps compensate for flickering light sources and provides consistent exposure and color during continuous shooting.\n\u2022 Built-in intervalometer and bulb timer helps deliver expanded creativity.\n\u2022 1.3x and 1.6x crop shooting adds superb flexibility while still delivering high resolution images required for demanding applications.\n\u2022 Intelligent Viewfinder II with approximately 100 viewfinder coverage.\n\u2022 Full HD 30p movie capability and Time Lapse Movie function which takes still photographs at set intervals and combines them into a Full HD movie file.\n\u2022 High-speed continuous shooting up to 5.0 fps allows you to capture fast action.\n\u2022 3.2-inch ClearView II LCD monitor 170\u00b0 viewing angle 1040000-dot VGA reflection resistance with multi coating and high-transparency materials for bright and clear viewing.\n\u2022 Customizable Quick Control Screen allows you to quickly change frequently used camera settings and functions.\n\u2022 Support for USB 3.0.",
