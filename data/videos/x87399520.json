Think back to the last time you went to the movie theater and had to sit in one of the front three rows. Chances are you walked out of the theater with a stiff neck. Cranking your neck into an unnatural position for any extended period of time is going to cause temporary discomfort, but doing so for even short periods of time, day after day, can have lasting effects, such as chronic headaches. \n\nNow with MantelMount, you can avoid this situation altogether. No matter where your sitting\/standing\/laying\/cheering in front of your TV, the positioning of the screen is yours for the taking.",
