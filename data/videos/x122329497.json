    "description": "Features:\n\nSensor Cycle\nGet perfect cleaning every time with the Sensor cycle. The AccuSense\u00ae soil sensor measures load size and soil level during the prewash, and the dishwasher adjusts to the right wash and dry settings throughout the wash cycle to deliver precise cleaning to your dishes.\nTotalCoverage Spray Arm\nThe TotalCoverage spray arm cleans with twice the jets2 for more coverage. A smarter sequence of spray patterns hits dishes from multiple nozzles throughout the cycle, so you can be sure they're all clean and ready to go.\n1-Hour Wash Cycle\nThe 1-Hour Wash option will get dishes clean in about half the time.\nTap Touch Controls\nClean these controls as easily as you use them.\nNo One Has Fewer Repairs 20 Years in a Row \nFor 20 years in a row, no other brand has had fewer dishwasher repairs, so you can rest assured it will continue to function the way your family needs it to.\nSoil Sensor \nDetermines how dirty dishes are and adjusts the Normal cycle as needed to make sure dishes come out clean.\nIn-Door Silverware Basket \nFrees up rack space by easily fitting on the front of the lower rack or in the door to make room for more dishes.\nAdjustable Upper Rack  \nManually raise or lower the upper rack two inches to better fit tall items.\nSani Rinse Option\nSanitizes dishes by eliminating 99.99% of food and bacteria.\nStainless Steel Tub\nPromotes drying by retaining heat from wash and rinse cycles. Plus, it cools faster than the dishes so moisture can condense on the interior walls and not the dishes.\nFingerprint-Resistant\nHide fingerprints and smudges with steel that easily wipes clean. Available in Black Stainless, Sunset Bronze, and Stainless Steel colors.\nNormal Cycle\nUse for normal amounts of food soil to clean up leftover messes from your day-to-day meals.\nHeavy Cycle\nTake care of baked-on messes and other heavily soiled items without the extra elbow grease by adding extra time to the cycle.\nHigh Temperature Wash Option\nGives items like baby bottles, glassware or dishes a more thorough clean.\nHeated Dry Option \nUse a clean, dry dish straight from the dishwasher thanks to added heat for drying. For optimal drying results, use this option with rinse aid.\nExtended Dry Option\nCycle Status Indicator\nThe full lit display glows for wash, drain, drying, sanitized and clean along with the time in hours and minutes so there's no need to guess when your dishes will be ready.\nENERGY STAR\u00ae Certified \nENERGY STAR\u00ae certified models exceed government standards to help save money on your utility bills.\nDesigned, Engineered and Assembled in the U.S.A. with American Pride",
