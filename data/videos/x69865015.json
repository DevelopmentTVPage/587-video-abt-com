The Bosch PS10BN 12V Max I-Driver fits the capabilities of a full-size driver into a tool small enough to fit in the pocket of your tool belt. Bosch's compact driver delivers 80 in.-lb of torque via a seven-speed clutch, always providing the perfect amount of power. The five-position articulating head with integrated LED lamp is just 3.5\" in total length, which makes the I-Driver the perfect tool for tasks in even the most cramped spaces. And using the Bosch compact driver doesn't come with a compromise in performance: A single charge of the lithium-ion battery (not included) provides enough power to drive 100 3\" screws. For a big job in a small space, the Bosch PS10BN is the clear choice.\nFeatures:\n\u2022 80-Inch-Pound of Torque\nDrives 100 3-Inch screws per battery charge \n\u2022 35-Inch total head length\n3 times shorter than most popular competitor \n\u2022 90-Degree articulating head\nRotates and locks into five positions for increased versatility \n\u2022 Custom Exact-Fit Tool Inlays\nCustom inserts that hold individual tools in place with room underneath to store other tool accessories \n\u2022 Tool Only (battery not included)",
