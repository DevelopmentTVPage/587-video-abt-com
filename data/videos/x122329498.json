    "description": "Sensor Cycle \nAutomatically selects the right wash and dry settings for your load by using two separate sensors to measure temperature, soil level and load size once during the prewash and once during the wash cycle.\n\n1-Hour Wash Cycle \nClean dishes in half the time2 so your plates, pans and glasses are thoroughly cleaned up and taken care of in just an hour.\n\nNo One Has Fewer Repairs 20 Years in a Row \nFor 20 years in a row, no other brand has had fewer dishwasher repairs, so you can rest assured it will continue to function the way your family needs it to.\n\nTotalCoverage Spray Arm \nCleans with twice the jets1 for more coverage while a smarter sequence of spray patterns from multiple nozzles hits your dishes with increased water pressure.\n\nTap Touch Controls \nClean these controls as easily as you use them.\n\nSoil Sensor \nDetermines how dirty dishes are and adjusts the Normal cycle as needed to make sure dishes come out clean.\n\nIn-Door Silverware Basket \nFrees up rack space by easily fitting on the front of the lower rack or in the door to make room for more dishes.\n\nAdjustable Upper Rack \nManually raise or lower the upper rack two inches to better fit tall items.\n\nNormal Cycle \nUse for normal amounts of food soil to clean up leftover messes from your day-to-day meals.\n\nHeavy Cycle \nTake care of heavily-soiled messes and other hard-to-clean dishes without the extra elbow grease by adding extra time to the cycle.\n\nHigh Temperature Wash Option \nGives items like baby bottles, glassware or dishes a more thorough clean.\n\nHeated Dry Option \nUse a clean, dry dish straight from the dishwasher thanks to added heat for drying. For optimal drying results, use this option with rinse aid.\n\nCycle Status Indicator \nThe full lit display glows for wash, drain, drying, sanitized and clean along with the time in hours and minutes so there's no need to guess when your dishes will be ready.\n\nEnergy Star Certified \nENERGY STAR certified models exceed government standards to help save money on your utility bills.\n\nExtended Dry Option\n\nDesigned, Engineered and Assembled in the U.S.A. with American Pride",
