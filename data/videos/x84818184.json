    "description": "Abt Electronics talks to Klipsch about their new Forte speaker.\n\nBack by popular demand, the Klipsch Fort\u00e9 III delivers classic Heritage performance with new retro-cool styling. Hand-made in Hope, AR, this sonic marvel packs a punch while providing clear, multi-dimensional sound. Fort\u00e9\u2019s narrow profile and clean lines harbor a wealth of advanced acoustic technology. As the first truly full-range speaker in the Heritage lineup, audiophiles will be impressed by Fort\u00e9\u2019s highly-efficient horn loaded tweeter and updated larger mid-range driver \u2013 both with new titanium diaphragms for a smoother response. The slim design houses a powerful 12\u201d woofer and 15\u201d passive radiator for jaw-dropping tight, enveloping bass.\n\nThe newest member to the Heritage family, the Forte III. Incorporating luxury materials such as real wood veneer and a lambswool grille, the Forte III blends the acoustics and classic design legacy of Paul W. Klipsch with the latest technologies available today. The floorstanding speakers provide clean, multi-dimensional sound and true, full-range performance with a narrow profile.\n\nLearn More at http:\/\/www.klipsch.com\/ces-2017",
