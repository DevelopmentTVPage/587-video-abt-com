But it gives you a place to store and charge 5 iOS devices at one time from a single power source. We think its the perfect charging solution for small offices or work groups or a family full of iPhone users.\nPowerDock 5 gives each tablet its own charging port and its own frosted backrest and each charging bay is roomy enough to accommodate your iPhone iPod or iPad in their cases.\nPowerDock 5 is optimized for iOS devices (iPad iPad mini iPhone iPod touch iPod nano) although our testing indicates that PowerDocks 5V (2.1 amp) charging circuitry will also charge most Kindle and Android devices. Many smartphones and tablets have unique charging requirements so PowerDock may not charge your device as fast as youre used to. Make sure you check your devices manual for any special requirements.\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Store and charge 5 iPads iPhones or iPod touches simultaneously\n\u2022 Space-saving design for your countertop\n\u2022 Cables not included\n\u2022 Input: 100-240 V AC\n\u2022 Output: 10 watts (5 volts DC @ 2.1 amps) for each charging bay\n\u2022 Accommodates iPad tablets in their cases",
