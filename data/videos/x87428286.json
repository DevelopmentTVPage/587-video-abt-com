It makes light work of slicing with absolute precision. A uniquely shaped ruffle blade joins straight, serrated and crinkle blades to slice thin cucumbers, thick onion rings and anything in between, with a turn of the soft dial. Thin and thick julienne blades make terrific French fries, carrot sticks and garnishes. The Mandoline's soft handle, positioned lower than the Mandoline runway, ensures a comfortable grip and keeps hands out of the way. Nonslip feet keep it stable, and the large food holder keeps food in place while protecting fingers. All blades are easily removable for cleaning, come with safety covers and can store on board. Legs fold compactly for storage.",
