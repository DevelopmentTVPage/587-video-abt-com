It automatically remembers the last cycle you picked so it's stored and ready to go.\n\n- For over 20 years in a row, no other brand has had fewer dishwasher repairs, so you can rest assured it will continue to function the way your family needs it to.\n\n- Determines how dirty dishes are and adjusts the Normal cycle as needed to make sure dishes come out clean.\n\n- Manually raise or lower the upper rack two inches to better fit tall items.\n\n- Sanitizes dishes by eliminating 99.99% of food and bacteria.\n\n- Hide fingerprints and smudges with steel that easily wipes clean.
