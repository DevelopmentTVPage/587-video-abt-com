    "description": "Abt Electronics talks to Alpine about their X-Series subwoofers.\n\nX-Series Subwoofers\n- The new X-Series subwoofers are the X-W12D4 12-inch Dual 4 Ohm and the X-W10D4 10-inch Dual 4 Ohm. They deliver strong bass with tight control, just as expected from premium subwoofers. Key features include:\n\n- 900W RMS, making it a perfect match for the new X-Series X-A90M 900W mono amplifier\n- 28mm linear Xmax (1 way), 56 mm peak to peak\n- Dual spiders for precision control over the large dynamic range\n- Dual shorting rings for strong motor control ensuring low THD and tight bass\n- cCenter pole radial heat sink which wicks heat away from the voice coil and transfers it outside the motor, for long term high output\n- The biggest HAMR surround yet, for linear cone movement throughout its large range of excursion\n- Light but rigid pulp\/mica cone which allows for highly accurate bass with great natural tone\n\nLearn more: http:\/\/www.alpine-usa.com\/company\/press\/ces2017\/2017\/alpine-electronics-redesigns-its-sound-system-philosophy-with-alpine-id",
