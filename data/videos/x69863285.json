With new fl ush-fi\u00act design and the ability to easily slide into existing kitchen spaces or be integrated behind kitchen cabinetry these family-size refrigerators offer a seamless look to the kitchen while providing excellent food care with ActiveSmart\u2122 technology.\nFeatures:\n\u2022 What is ActiveSmart\u2122?\nActiveSmart\u2122 consists of a microprocessor interior temperature sensors independently controlled variable speed fans and multiple air ducts. The microprocessor controls how the refrigerator operates based on changing patterns of use. The sensors continuously send information to the microprocessor which analyses and adjusts the fan speed and compressor operations accordingly to deliver a consistent and stable temperature. Continuous feedback means that ActiveSmart\u2122 adjusts to the way you live. Its ability to respond to daily use means that it only uses the energy needed to keep your food fresher for longer.\n\u2022 How ActiveSmart\u2122 helps you.\no Independent Control = Better Food Care\nThe Humidity Control System together with the cool and consistent temperature delivered by ActiveSmart\u2122 FoodCare creates the perfect microclimate for your produce.\no Greater Intelligence = Greater Efficiency\nSensors constantly record changes to fridge and freezer compartments including when the doors are opened and when new items are introduced ensuring temperature in each compartment is kept constant.\no Rapid Chilling = Optimised Food Preservation\nIndependent variable-speed fans control airflow through multiple air ducts to all compartment as well as rapid chill and freezing to ensure food safety and maintain food quality.\n\u2022 Real Integration \nContemporary kitchens are living spaces. Part of this evolution is increasingly refined design flush fit cabinetry and appliances that enhance ergonomics as well as provide options to either showcase through crisp stainless steel or combine through custom panel finishes. Our built-in series is designed to be seamless.\n\u2022 Sized to Suit \nThe spacious 36 French Door refrigerators are designed for family life with double doors for easy access to uninterrupted refrigerator space.\n\u2022 Flexible Living \nThese refrigerators adapt to suit your lifestyle by streamlining food preparation and organization with SmartTouch controls flexible shelving and storage options and slide out bins and trays.

LED lighting in all compartments lights up all the shelves bins and trays.\n\u2022 Easy Cleaning \nRemovable spill-safe cantilevered glass shelves are designed to contain drips and spills that can be simply wiped away while leaving the interior walls completely smooth and easy to clean. Storage bins and EZkleen stainless steel doors just need a wipe to keep spotless.\n\u2022 Efficient \nThese ActiveSmart\u2122 refrigerators intelligently adapt to daily use to help save energy cooling and defrosting only when they need to without compromising on food care. As a result the Fisher & Paykel Built-in series carries an Energy Star rating.",
