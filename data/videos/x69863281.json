Controlled by a powerful audio brain Mu-so Qb is alive with custom-made features all designed in our audio laboratories in England. It\u2019s a true feat of sound engineering. From the contours of the glass-filled polymer casing to the bass radiators that help create huge low frequencies \u2013 every millimetre of space has been used to great effect.

Simply sync the units to play the same song beat-for-beat in up to five rooms.\nGo Deeper\n\u2022 Mu-so Qb is a wireless music system alive with innovation.\no Every component tailored - One of the biggest design challenges with Mu-so Qb was to configure the individual speakers within the smaller cabinet. To achieve that distinctive Naim sound our engineers had to interrogate every component and adjust speaker angles by the smallest of fractions. It led us to an arrangement of five drivers offset and angled perfectly to create a left-right dispersion asymmetry. In this arrangement are two microfibre dome tweeters and two mid drivers all four driven by 50W amplifiers with rare earth magnets and copper-capped poles for even greater accuracy. And for low frequencies we\u2019ve installed two pistonic passive bass radiators. These work alongside a custom-made woofer that\u2019s driven by a 100W amplifier to create an astonishing bass sound for a system this size. When the speakers and woofer combine Mu-so Qb amplification can generate an incredible 300 watts.\no Controlling the Mu-so Qb Sound - At the heart of Mu-so Qb is a 32-bit digital signal processor - the same high-spec component used in the original Mu-so system. Fine-tuned in our listening room it controls the flow of music information to each speaker drawing on everything weve learned from designing the best in-car audio systems from Bentley motors. It also includes two EQ settings tailoring the best sound quality whether the unit is close to or away from the edge of any room. The end result is a refined audio experience with no distortion increased speaker accuracy and an expansive sound that makes hairs stand on end.\nFeatures:\n\u2022 UPnP\u2122 (Universal Plug n Play)\nStream music from a PC Mac or network-attached storage in high-resolution better than CD quality.\n\u2022 Multiroom Ready\nPlay music between any combination of Mu-so Qbs and Mu-sos in up to five rooms of your home.
