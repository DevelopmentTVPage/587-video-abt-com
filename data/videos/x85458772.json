Hassle-free: No cord to unravel, plug in, drag around and restrict your reach. You can quickly and easily clean when you need to.\n- Direct-drive cleaner head: Direct-drive cleaner head drives bristles deep into the carpet to remove ground-in dirt. 150% more brush bar power than the Dyson V6 cord-free vacuum.\n- 150% more brush bar power than the Dyson V6 cord-free vacuum. A powerful direct-drive motor pushes the brush bar deep into the carpet to remove ground-in dirt.\n- Stiff nylon bristles remove ground-in dirt from carpets. Carbon fiber filaments remove fine dust from hard floors. Bristles cover its full width, allowing edge-to-edge cleaning.\n- Soft roller cleaner head: Invented for hard floors. Soft roller cleaner head removes large debris and fine dust simultaneously.\nThe Dyson V8 Absolute vacuum comes with the Soft roller cleaner head. Full-width coverage: soft woven nylon, with rows of anti-static carbon fiber filaments enabling simultaneous fine dust and large debris pick-up.\nThe cleaning roller is covered in soft woven nylon. The fibers envelop large debris, allowing it to pass under the cleaner head and into the vacuum while maintaining a tight seal with the floor. Meanwhile, rows of soft anti-static carbon fiber filaments remove fine dust.\n- HEPA filtration: Whole machine HEPA filtration captures allergens and expels cleaner air than the air you breathe.\nCaptures and retains dust using patented 2 Tier Radial\u2122 cyclones. 15 cyclones, arranged across two tiers, generate powerful centrifugal forces to spin dust and dirt out of the airflow.\nWhole machine HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. And because the entire system is engineered to be sealed, the air that leaves the machine is cleaner than the air you breathe.\n- Powered by the Dyson digital motor V8: The Dyson digital motor V8 creates the most powerful cordless vacuum.\n- 2 Tier Radial\u2122 cyclones: 15 cyclones, arranged across two tiers, work in parallel to increase airflow and capture fine dust.\nDyson cord-free vacuums use patented cyclone technology, just like our corded machines. Powerful centrifugal forces spin dust and dirt out of the air and into the bin.\nThis patented cyclone technology combines with the Dyson digital motor and a re-engineered nickel manganese cobalt battery to ensure that Dyson cord-free machines provide powerful fade-free suction. From the moment your start cleaning, to the moment you finish.\n- Up to 40 minutes of powerful fade-free suction: The Dyson V8 Absolute cord-free vacuum is powered by a new Lithium-ion battery to deliver up to 40 minutes of fade free suction. (up to 25 minutes with motorized floor tool attached)\nMany other handheld vacuum cleaners remain switched on from the moment cleaning starts. Battery power is wasted between cleaning tasks.\nDyson cord-free vacuum cleaners have a run-time enhancing trigger. Trigger grip releases instantly, meaning battery power is only used for vacuuming. On when you need it, off when you don't.\n- Max power mode: Slide switch to select power. Provides up to 7 minutes of higher suction for more difficult tasks.\n- Transforms to clean up high: Lightweight and balanced for floor to ceiling cleaning. Cleans up top, down low and in-between.\n- Transforms to a handheld: All Dyson cord-free vacuums quickly convert to a handheld for quick clean ups, spot cleaning and cleaning difficult places.\n- Hygienic bin emptying: Ejects dust in a single action. New Hygienic dirt ejector Ejects dust from the bin in a single action.\n- Convenient docking station: Stores and charges the machine, and holds additional attachments. Charging and storing the vacuum on the docking station means it's always ready to go.",
