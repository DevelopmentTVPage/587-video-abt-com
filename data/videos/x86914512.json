For a closer look or to place an order be sure to stop by Abt.com: http:\/\/www.abt.com\/product\/105671\/Dyson-Cinetic-Big-Ball-Animal-Canister-Vacuum-21489501.html?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=N331_20170314&utm_medium=video \n\nFeatures:\n- Dyson Cinetic\u2122 science: Dyson's most efficient cyclones capture more dust, dirt and microscopic particles\n- The only vacuum with no dirty filters to wash or replace: Dust separation is so efficient that, unlike with other vacuums, there's no need to wash or replace a filter\n- The only vacuum that gets back up when toppled: Others vacuums fall down and stay down. Only Dyson Big Ball cylinder vacuums pick themselves up\n- Hygienically ejects the dirt: Drive out trapped dust and debris with just the push of a button. There's no need to touch the dirt\n- Carbon fiber turbine head: Stiff nylon bristles remove dirt from carpet, and soft carbon fiber filaments gently remove dust from hard floors\n- Ball\u2122 technology: With improved stability. Dyson Big Ball canister vacuums maneuver easily around obstacles and corners\n- Articulated handle for easy, versatile cleaning: The wand's handle now rotates in three directions, allowing full 360\u00b0 articulation for greater control\n- Large, high-capacity bin: Allows for more cleaning time before it needs emptying\n- Quick-release tools: Smoothly change tools between tasks\n- Longer wand reaches awkward areas: Extends up to 4.1ft to clean hard-to-reach places\n- Suction Power: 250AW\n- Bin Volume: 0.42 gallons\n- Cord length: 21 ft\n- Maximum reach: 35 ft",
