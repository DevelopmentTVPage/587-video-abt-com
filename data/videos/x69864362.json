The 4-stage auger will now set you up with two auger assemblies. This allows you to have two auger ejector styles pre-set in the auger assemblies. Now when you are cleaning your gutter and need to switch to another auger style you can quickly swap out to your second auger.\n\u2022 The additional sets of ejectors and breakers allow you to change the cleaning style of your auger. Use the scoop ejectors and I-beam breaker for watery debris or the compact ejectors and cross-serrated breaker for low gutter straps. Use the standard ejectors and serrated breaker for everyday seasonal debris.\n\u2022 The accessory kit also comes with an additional scraper with interchangeable accessories. Depending on the amount and type of debris use either the standard rubber squeegee or the wire bristles for the most thorough cleaning.\n\u2022 The included soft storage case keeps Looj and all its parts and accessories safe and protected during storage and allows for easy handling to and from the job site.",
