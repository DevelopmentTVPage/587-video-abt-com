By mounting your curved TV, you can make more than just one seat in your room the perfect seat to get the immersive curved TV experience. It is imperative to view a curved TV in the \u2018sweet spot,\u2019 right in the center of your TV \u2013 and this mount allows you to swivel your TV to get that sweet spot view in any seat in the room. This mount was engineered with 10 degrees of swivel left and right, and the ideal viewing range is increased by over 20 degrees compared to having a curved TV on a stand. The VLC1 is safety-tested, UL Certified. The VLC1\u2019s open wall plate design allows you to easily route cables behind your TV and accommodate a standard size electrical outlet. After installation, the VLC1 allows tool-less height, level and side-to-side adjustments for perfect TV placement.\n\nAbt is a proud authorized retailer of SANUS TV & Speaker Mounts.
