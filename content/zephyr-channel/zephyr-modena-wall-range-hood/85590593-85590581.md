    "description": "A \ufb02oating canopy made of steel and glass, Modena houses the most advanced Bloom\u2122 HD LED light bulbs and electronic LCD controls within its one-inch thin stainless steel canopy. Nestled discreetly between the chimney and its outer ring, Modena's glass canopy adds a sense of lightness, augmenting the range hood's symmetry and low-pro\ufb01le design. A study in clean modern simplicity, Modena comes pre-loaded with DCBL Suppression System\u2122 technology so its performance will be as stunning as its looks.",
