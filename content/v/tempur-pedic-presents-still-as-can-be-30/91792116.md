    "description": "You\u2019ve heard Tempur-Pedic is better. But do you know why? \u2026If you\u2019re familiar with the iconic wine glass test, you know that it\u2019s proof that Tempur-Pedic is in a class of its own in reducing motion transfer. It means you sleep still and undisturbed through the night. So we set out to prove it once again\u2026with dancers, yoga, backflips, sledgehammers and kids who just had a lot of sugar. As always, the wine glass remains still as can be. Ordinary memory foam and spring mattresses just don\u2019t compare. \n\nThere\u2019s simply nothing like a Tempur-Pedic \u2014 reduced motion transfer for undisturbed, life-changing sleep.",
