    "description": "PX uses built-in sensors to enhance the way you instinctively use a set of headphones. Put them on your head and they\u2019ll switch on: take them off and they\u2019ll return to stand-by mode. Lift an ear cup to talk or hang them round your neck and PX will pause the music, resuming playback when you\u2019re ready to listen.
