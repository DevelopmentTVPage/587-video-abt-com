    "description": "the Boss from Breville\n\nEasy to use high velocity super blender.\n\nYou are what you eat.\n\nHow do you make frozen desserts without preservatives, nut butters without salt and sugar, hot soups without flavorings, mayonnaise without emulsifiers, soy milks without stabilizers, and of course green smoothies you don\u2019t have to chew?\n\nThe Boss\u2122 features a high velocity ProKinetix\u00ae blade and bowl system that pulverizes virtually any combination of ingredients. Creating up to 50% smaller particles than traditional blending. This super fine texture increases absorption of nutrients and creates a smoother mouth feel that traditional blenders have not been able to achieve.\n\nCrush ice into snow for velvety cocktails. Liquefy and aerate for super fine soups and smoothies. With one touch programs including the world\u2019s first 'Green Smoothie\u2019 program minimizes the guesswork and reduces the risk of over processing. Control variable speeds ranging from a slow stir to a pulverizing high speed mill utilizing the manual speed selector",
