    "description": "An uprated camera is equipped with a 1-inch 20-megapixel sensor capable of shooting 4K\/60fps video and Burst Mode stills at 14 fps. The adoption of titanium alloy and magnesium alloy construction increases the rigidity of the airframe and reduces weight, making the Phantom 4 Pro similar in weight to the Phantom 4. The FlightAutonomy system adds dual rear vision sensors and infrared sensing systems for a total of 5-direction of obstacle sensing and 4-direction of obstacle avoidance.\n\nAbt is a proud authorized retailer of the DJI Phantom 4 Pro Drone.
