    "description": "Miele Induction Cooktops: Con@ctivity\n\nMiele's Con@ctivity 2.0 feature allows you to concentrate fully on cooking, leaving the rest up to its wireless technology. Con@ctivity 2.0 gathers information from the induction cooktop and transmits it to the ventilation hood, ensuring the hood operates at the optimum power setting based on your cooking environment. To avoid unnecessary energy consumption, once the cooktop is turned off the ventilation hood will run for up to 15 minutes, depending on what is being cooked.\n\nAbt is a proud authorized retailer of Miele Appliances.
