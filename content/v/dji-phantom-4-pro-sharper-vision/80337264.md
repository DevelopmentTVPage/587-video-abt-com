    "description": "The Phantom 4 Pro redefines the iconic Phantom series, bringing aerial imaging to new heights. The 1-inch sensor in the Phantom 4 Pro camera is four times the size of the Phantom 4, giving it wider dynamic range, better low light capabilities, sharper and more detailed images, and a maximum ISO of 12,800. \n\n\nPlease consult National Park regulations before your flight.
