Sub-Zeros pioneering technology - dual refrigeration air purification and advanced microprocessor controls chief among them - keep fresh and frozen foods alike in ideal conditions preserving their goodness longer.\nInside the Sub-Zero BI-42UFD has the most interior capacity of any counter-depth French door model and features a full-width deli drawer that takes maximum advantage of the refrigerators interior width. Overlay and stainless steel models are available and a flush inset design installation option allows the unit to sit flush with surrounding cabinetry.\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Dual refrigeration \nEach built-in combination unit comes with separate cooling systems for the refrigerator and freezer. Fresh food stays fresher in cool moist air on one side while frigid dry air prevents frost and freezer burn on the other \u2014 providing optimum preservation conditions for each type of food.\n\u2022 Maximum capacity in a 42 built-in French door model \nFor those moments when storage space is at a premium the Sub-Zero 42 over-and-under with French door provides nearly 25 cubic feet of combined refrigerator and freezer capacity. Thats more usable space than any built-in French door model with a refrigerator thats 12 roomier than a Sub-Zero 42 side-by-side model too.\n\u2022 Excellent design flexibility \nSub-Zeros built-in refrigeration models can be outfitted with stainless-steel panels or custom cabinetry panels and may be installed flush with surrounding cabinetry for a more integrated look. Handle and grille styles are also customizable.\n\u2022 Air purification system \nMany fresh foods emit ethylene gas a natural compound that hastens spoilage. Sub-Zeros built-in refrigerators come with an anti-microbial air-purification system (based on technology developed by NASA) that scrubs the air of ethylene as well as mold viruses and bacteria every 20 minutes.\n\u2022 Water filtration system \nThis low-maintenance system reduces suspended particles and chemical pollutants and filters out chlorine taste and odors in water used for ice production. The filter lasts for 1 year or 750 gallons and replacement is fast and easy.\n\u2022 Bright interior lighting\nEvenly distributed interior lighting \u2014 powered by specially designed 40-watt appliance bulbs in the refrigerator and freezer \u2014 illuminates food on shelves and in storage drawers when unit doors are open.\n\u2022 Low-temperature\/high-humidity storage zones \nCrispers and deli drawers are strategically located near the evaporator to maintain temperatures a few degrees cooler than the rest of the unit. Drawers are sealed to lock in humidity and freshness.\n\u2022 Informational freshness cards \nDifferent foods require different storage procedures. Thats why located inside each built-in refrigerator unit specially designed freshness cards provide easy-to-follow tips for ensuring maximum food preservation.\n\u2022 Ice making features \nAn automatic icemaker provides crescent-shaped ice cubes and includes a max ice feature capable of increasing purified ice production by up to 40 percent for a 24-hour period.\n\u2022 Six adjustable refrigerator shelves \nThe 42 over-and-under with French door is the only Sub-Zero with refrigerator shelving that is split into two columns for maximum flexibility. Line up two half-shelves to form a full-width shelf or stagger their positions to customize storage for tall or short items.\n\u2022 Nano-coated spill-proof shelving \nA microthin layer of coating applied to the sides of each modular shelf prevents spills from spreading \u2014 making cleanup a breeze.\n\u2022 Full-width deli compartment \nA soft-close deli drawer that spans the width of the refrigerators interior provides ample room for packages and trays of meats cheeses and more. Plastic dividers can be arranged for extra organization or removed altogether.",
