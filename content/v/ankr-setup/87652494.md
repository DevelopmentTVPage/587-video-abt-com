    "description": "ANKR Smart Tracker\n\nThe ANKR Smart Tracker is a small electronic device that makes your stuff smart and hard to lose. Now your things can let you know when they're about to be left behind. This Gunmetal Black-colored device is sleek and thin, perfect for adding to your keys and bag or for sliding into your wallet. It features \"no-pairing\" Bluetooth technology, so it sets up in seconds and easily communicates with your smartphone right out of the box. Using ANKR's free mobile app, add and manage multiple Smart Trackers and Safe Zones, and see which items are with you. If something is left behind, we'll alert you and give you directions back to it. Once you're nearby, you can \"ring\" your ANKR to help find it quickly.",
