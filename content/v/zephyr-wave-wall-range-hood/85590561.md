    "description": "The Wave looks great with any number of d\u00e9cor styles, from transitional to modern, and the elegant tilt lends a slim profile to this kitchen workhorse. Ingenious dual capture zones ensure a smoke and debris-free kitchen. Offering a glowing tri-level LED light strip, and a choice of black or white glass and an optional duct cover, the Wave is a true kitchen classic.\n\nSee our capture test video for examples of Wave in action. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F6ABRRt7DGI\n\nLearn more at http:\/\/zephyronline.com\/products\/arc\/wave_wall",
