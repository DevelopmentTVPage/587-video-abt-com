Today, Smeg is run by the third generation of Bertazzoni, but it still keeps the memory of its beginnings alive in its name, an acronym for Smalterie Metallurgiche Emiliane Guastalla (\"Emilian metallurgical enamel works of Guastalla\"). \n\nOver time, the brand has established itself as a symbol of high aesthetic. Each new appliance for SMEG is a special artifact, which arises from a deep study of design, ergonomics and function. Smeg's internal design studio has the support of internationally renowned designers such as Dolce and Gabbana, Guido Canali, Mario Bellini, the Piano Design studio, Marc Newson, Giancarlo Candeago, Matteo Bazzicalupo and Raffaella Mangiarotti.",
