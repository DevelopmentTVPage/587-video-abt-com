    "description": "See how Chef Ann Nolan uses the Jenn-Air\u00ae downdraft cooktop to prepare delicious spicy shrimp pot stickers.  Learn about the features that make this cooktop great.\n\nChef Ann Nolan, the Culinary Training Chef for Jenn-Air, prepares this pot sticker recipe with a coconut curry sauce. The powerful 17,000 BTU burner on this luxury downdraft cooktop creates a nice color for the pot stickers; once the sauce is added, the downdraft ventilation captures the steam right at the cooking surface and pulls it away. The impressive JX3\u2122 Ventilation System clears the air of smoke, steam and odors as you cook, all without a hood. Jenn-Air\u00ae JX3\u2122 downdraft cooktops feature the industry's best performing ventilation system.*",
