We recommend that you use natural outdoor light or an incandescant light source 20 from the watch for charging a watch in this state. However office light is sufficient for keeping your watch continually charged \no Incandescant 20 (3000 Lux) 46 Hours \no Outdoors cloudy (10000 Lux) 14 Hours \no Outdoors Sunny (100000 Lux) 7 Hours\nFootnotes:\n\u2022 After a full recharge from a low or no charge state it will be necessary to perform an all reset and in some cases a 0-positioning. If this is not done your watch may not operate correctly.\n\u2022 For simple analog models pull the crown out the time setting position leave there for 30 seconds return the crown to the closed position next to the case then set the time. For other than simple analog models (perpetual calendar multi-function and specialty pieces) please refer to your instruction manual or the instruction sets on our web site for the all reset and 0-positioning procedures.",
