    "description": "Breville The Custom Loaf Bread Maker - BBM800XL\n\nThe smartest bread maker. Ever.\n\nThere's nothing like waking up to a freshly baked loaf of bread. But when there are over 60 different recipes to choose from, how do you make sure you get it right?\n\nA very clever interface computes temperature and baking time when you make a selection, while a super easy Turn and Confirm dial gets you started on any recipe in seconds. It even lets you select what time you want the bread to be ready, adds fruits and nuts at the appropriate time, and lets you create your own recipes.\n\nIt's the greatest thing since, well ... you know.",
