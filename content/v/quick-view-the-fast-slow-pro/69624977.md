    "description": "Breville 6 Quart Fast Slow Pro Pressure Cooker and Slow Cooker - BPR700BSS\n\nSome foods are tender with time, others are tastier under pressure, but how do you know the pressure, temperature and time different foods need ?\n\nIts all possible with the 'Fast Slow Pro' a multicooker with pressure and slow cook menus that automatically adjust time, temperature and pressure between fast and slow cooking. Dual sensors at the top and bottom monitor ingredients for more accurate temperature and pressure control, while the hands free steam release automatically varies across foods to maximize flavour and texture.\n \nSo now you can pressure cook, slow cook, steam, reduce, saute and sear with the press of a button and you can rely on the fully interactive LCD to tell you when its building pressure, cooking and releasing steam.",
