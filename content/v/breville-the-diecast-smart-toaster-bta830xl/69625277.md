    "description": "Breville Die-Cast 4-Slice Smart Toaster - BTA830XL\n\n'Lift and Look'\u00ae and 'A Bit More'\u00ae at a touch of a button\n\nA new world of bread needs a new world of toasting. So how do you toast any type of bread and get it just the way you like it?\n\nThe toaster's elegant push button controls include 'Lift and Look'\u00ae and 'A Bit More'\u00ae. 'Lift and Look'\u00ae activates the motorized carriage to gently raise the bread just long enough to check if it's done. Press 'A Bit More'\u00ae and the carriage lowers once more to give it just a little extra toasting time. LEDs count down the toasting progress. Full die-cast construction, automatic raising and lowering, bagel, frozen and adjustable volume settings.\n\nOne touch. Perfection.",
