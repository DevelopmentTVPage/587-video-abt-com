Perfect for commercial and fine art photography or any other application that calls for extremely high-resolution the EOS 5DS is the ultimate combination of EOS performance and ultra-high megapixel capture. It features an advanced 61-point High Density Reticular AF system that includes 41 cross-type AF points and EOS iTR AF for precise AF in numerous situations. An anti-flicker function helps provide consistent exposure and color during continuous shooting under certain lighting conditions while a built-in bulb timer and intervalometer expands creative opportunities without the need for an additional remote control. A refined mirror control mechanism reduces vibration and a Time Release Lag setting minimizes camera shake for sharp image capture when using mirror lock-up. New features like a crop function of 1.3x and 1.6x and a Custom Quick Control screen are complemented by advanced multi-featured Full HD Movie capture with Time Lapse Movie and much more.
