    "description": "Breville Juice Fountain Plus Stainless Steel Juicer - JE98XL\n\nEnjoy fresh juice, everyday with the Breville Juice Fountain Plus Stainless Steel Juicer - JE98XL. When creating the Breville Juice Fountain Plus, Breville chose to offer two different motor speeds. The low speed, which measures in at 6,500 RPM, lets the Breville Juice Fountain easily juice leafy vegetables or soft fruit. The high speed, however, measures at 12,000 RPM, to accurately juice denser fruits as well as hard vegetables. On top of this, an extra-wide chute has been added allowing the Breville Juicer to process whole fruits and vegetables without any precutting. If this isn't enough, the Breville Juice Fountain also comes with a large capacity pulp container, as well as a stainless steel micro mesh filter basket, to ensure that your juice is smooth every time. Enjoy your favorite fruits and vegetables in juice form, with the Breville Juice Fountain Plus.",
