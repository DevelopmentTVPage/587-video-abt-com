    "description": "Meet the all-new Nest Protect. The smoke alarm other alarms look up to.\n\nIt\u2019s time to expect more from your smoke alarm. The new Nest Protect has been redesigned from the inside out. It has an industrial-grade smoke sensor, tests itself automatically, and lasts up to a decade. It\u2019s also the first alarm you can hush from your phone. And just like the original Nest Protect, it tells you what\u2019s wrong and can even alert your phone.\n\nAbt is a proud authorized retailer of Nest. Shop on www.Abt.com or stop by our Glenview showroom to see our full selection of Nest products.",
