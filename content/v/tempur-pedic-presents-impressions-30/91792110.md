    "description": "You\u2019ve heard Tempur-Pedic is better. But do you know why? One-of-a-kind Tempur material precisely adapts to any shape, while reducing pressure points. So we set out to show just how Tempur material conforms to every nook and cranny by making some \u201cimpressions.\u201d Originally developed by NASA for cushioning and support during takeoff, we perfected Tempur material for sleepers, adapting to your shape, weight and temperature. It becomes soft where you want it, and firm where you need it. Ordinary memory foam mattresses just don\u2019t adapt or relieve pressure in the same way.  \n\nThere\u2019s simply nothing like a Tempur-Pedic \u2014 deeper pressure relief for life-changing sleep.",
