    "description": "Abt Electronics talks to Samsung about their new QLED TV.\n\nThe new Quantum dots allow Samsung QLED TV to express deep blacks and rich detail regardless of how light or dark the scene is, or whether the content is being played in a brightly lit or darkened room. Furthermore, Samsung QLED TV can generate peak luminance as high as 1,500 to 2,000 nits, with no impact on its ability to deliver accurate and impeccable color. With its metal alloy Quantum Dot technology, brightness no longer has to be compromised to boost color performance, which is also maintained regardless of how wide the viewing angle may be. QLED TVs are capable of reproducing 100 percent color volume. This means they can express all colors at any level of brightness \u2013 with even the subtlest differences visible at the QLED\u2019s peak luminance.\n\n\nLearn more at https:\/\/news.samsung.com\/global\/samsung-electronics-ushers-in-a-new-era-in-home-entertainment-with-qled-tv-ahead-of-ces-2017",
