    "description": "Precise Humidity Control and Continuous-drainage Operation\n\nHave a room or area that needs powerful dehumidification? Friedrich offers models that can extract 25, 50 or 70 pints of moisture every 24 hours. \n\nLarger capacity models D50BPA have built-in drain pumps that can pump condensation vertically or horizontally up to a combined distance of 15 feet. All three models provide continuous-drainage operation and can be set to precise humidity levels from 30% to 90%. Precise humidity control is so important that the EPA\u2019s proposed ENERGY STAR\u00ae Version 2.1 Dehumidifier specification may require a digital humidity readout or dial. \n\nSee the features list and Specifications by Model for details. \n\nIdeal for storage areas, basements, equipment rooms or anywhere moisture is a concern, Friedrich dehumidifiers provide reliable, convenient operation.",
