    "description": "Breville Sous Chef 12-Cup Food Processor, Model BFP660SIL\n\nFood preparation has never been easier. Three feed chute options for precise results. The 5\u201d large feed chute is wide enough for potatoes, or zucchini. The 2 \u00be\u201d mid feed chute offers greater control when processing medium size ingredients. The 1 \u00bd\u201d mini feed chute prevents long thin ingredients like carrots from tipping over during slicing. The adjustable slicer has 24 setting settings from paper thin (0.3mm) to thick cut (8.0mm) to customize and create restaurant quality precision cuts saving you time. A heavy duty 1000 watt induction motor, built like no other.",
