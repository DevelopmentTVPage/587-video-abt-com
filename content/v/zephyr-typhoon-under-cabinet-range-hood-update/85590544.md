    "title": "Zephyr Typhoon Under-Cabinet Range Hood Update",
    "description": "One of the inspirations for founding Zephyr Ventilation was our idea that the strict geometry of the under-cabinet range hood could use some serious updating. First, we crafted a smooth, sophisticated curvature and added 6-speed capacitive touch glass controls. Then, we pumped up the volume with a powerful, virtually noise-free 850-cfm blower. And dimmable halogen lights invite you and your guests to a warm respite from the everyday.",
