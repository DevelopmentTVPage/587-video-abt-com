    "description": "The SAB500 is built to withstand the rigors of a high-traffic workout facility while also maintaining a small enough footprint for smaller studios or homes. Gas-assisted adjustments makes transitions between exercises both painless and fast. A four-point base eliminates any rocking that can occur during workouts while transport wheels and handle make moving the bench a breeze. Foam rollers also ensure your legs stay steady throughout the exercises, allowing for better development of the intended muscles.\n\nWhether using the board for ab crunches, oblique bend, knee raises or any of the dozens of exercises possible, the SAB500 remains sturdy thanks to an oval 11-gauge steel frame.",
