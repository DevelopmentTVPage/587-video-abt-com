    "description": "Abt Electronics talks to Alpine about their Mech-Less Audio\/Nav System.\n\nThe X208U & INE-W977HD  are optimized for connectivity with an iPhone or Android\u2122 phone. The systems are designated as \u201cWork with Apple CarPlay\u201d models. Apple CarPlay lets iPhone users make and receive calls, access text messages, play music, and get directions in a way that allows them to stay focused on the road. Apple CarPlay is accessed through the capacitive touch screen or \u201cVoice\u201d hard key with Siri voice control and is compatible with iPhone 5 and later, including iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and the latest version of iOS.\n\nAudio features on the X208U & INE-W977HD include:\n\n- FLAC compatibility (Free Lossless Audio Codec): FLAC files can be played on the new models via USB, providing a truer listening experience.\n- HD Radio\u2122 Technology: The models have a built-in HD Radio receiver for free, crystal clear digital sound from the more than 2,000 AM and FM stations broadcasting with HD Radio Technology.\n- Pandora\u00ae internet radio: Pandora control is available from iPhone\u00ae and Android smartphones. Users can create new Pandora stations, rate songs with the thumbs up or down rating system, and bookmark songs for later purchase from the touchscreen.\n- SiriusXM: They are SiriusXM-Ready\u2122 and connect to the SiriusXM SXV300 Connect Vehicle Tuner Kit (sold separately, subscription required). SiriusXM features include: album art; display of channel logos; pause, rewind and replay up to 60 minutes of content while listening to satellite radio; start songs from the beginning when tuned to any favorite music channel using TuneStart\u2122; scan and select songs on favorite music channels with TuneScan\u2122.\n- iPod\u00ae and iPhone: The units are \u201cMade for iPod and iPhone\u201d compatible and have USB access to their iTunes library.\nAlpine TuneIt\u00ae App: The units are compatible with the Alpine TuneIt App, a free smartphone app for sound tuning. The app allows for tweaking of sound settings (like Time Correction, Parametric EQ and Crossover) via hand-picked adjustments or from pre-made settings in the database. If the vehicle has Alpine speakers and subwoofers, these items can also be selected for more precise tuning of the audio system. Settings can be shared with and rated by other users.\n- Alpine\u2019s MediaXpander\u00ae technology: This technology provides further enhanced sound quality by adding back missing harmonics in compressed media.\n\nLearn more at http:\/\/www.alpine-usa.com\/company\/press\/ces2017\/2017\/alpine-electronics-expands-entertainment-options-for-avn-and-av-systems",
