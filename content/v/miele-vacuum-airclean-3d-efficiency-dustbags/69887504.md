    "description": "Miele Vacuum AirClean 3D Efficiency Dustbags\n\nThe 3D AirClean dust bag by Miele promotes both clean air and cleanliness. With new 3D technology, the entire volume of the bag is effectively used like never before. The soft structure of the bag, particularly permeable to air, prevents 99.9% of fine dust particles from being released back into the air while vacuuming. Further enhance filtration with a HEPA AirClean filter- especially ideal for allergy sufferers. The air expelled from the machine is cleaner than ambient room air! By changing your Miele dust bag and HEPA filter as needed, your Miele will have the same cleaning performance as day one. This video tutorial provides all the information you need to maintain the filtration of your Miele vacuum cleaner.   \n\nAbt is a proud authorized retailer of Miele Vacuums & Vacuum Bags.
