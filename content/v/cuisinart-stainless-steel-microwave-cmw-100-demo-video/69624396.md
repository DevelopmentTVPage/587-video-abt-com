    "description": "A stainless steel interior and 25 preprogrammed settings put the Cuisinart\u00ae Microwave Oven in a class all its own. The ideal cooking environment, nonporous stainless steel, will not absorb odors, moisture or food particles. Preprogrammed one-touch controls guarantee that everything from reheating coffee, to defrosting cutlets, to cooking fish or making 2, 4, or 6 strips of crispy bacon will be done right. This 1000-watt, 1.0-cubic-foot oven lets you cook a meal from scratch, and make it a little healthier, without any oil or butter. With its stainless steel interior, stainless steel door and sleek control panel, this is a new generation of microwave - from Cuisinart, of course!",
