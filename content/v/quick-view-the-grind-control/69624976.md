    "description": "Breville Stainless Steel The Grind Control Coffee Maker - BDC650BSS\n\nEvery roast grinds differently. Brazilian or Columbian, light or dark, fresh or aged, there's a secret to bringing out their best.\n\nBreville's Grind Control\u2122 is the first household coffee maker with an adjustable grinder and calibration function that not only allows you to grind before you brew, you can also customize the grind size and coffee volume to suit your taste.\n\nGround coffee should be brewed within a minute of grinding as the volatile aromatics begin to dissipate almost immediately once ground. Therefore the built in grinder allows you to capture freshness and essential oils from the coffee beans by grinding right before you brew. The machined stainless steel burrs deliver consistent ground particle sizes for a more balanced, full flavored cup.\n\nBrew any size, without compromise on taste, with 'Steep and Release' technology. Choose either a carafe or brew directly into tall cups or travel mugs.",
