    "description": "Having a smart home sounds great. But it takes a ton of work to set up and program.\n\nThat's why Nest does things differently. \n\nNest products can learn about you and your home automatically.\n\nAnd when your other products work with Nest, they can use what Nest knows to help you save money, get comfortable, and stay safe \u2013 without you having to do a bunch of work. \n\nThat's not just smart. It's thoughtful. \n\nAbt is a proud authorized retailer of Nest. Shop on www.Abt.com or stop by our Glenview showroom to see our full selection of Nest products.",
